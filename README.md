# Things!

### You've tried it, now rate it (restaurants, theaters, movies, songs, meals, stores, pants, whatever...)

Keep a personal list of ratings for things you like or dislike or are on the fence about.

You do things, buy things, eat things, wear things, and go to things but you don’t always remember if you liked the thing.

Now...

Save things in your personal list. 

Organize them into categories.

Rate them on a scale of 1 o 5.

Write a review to remind yourself why you rated it that way.

And always...

Pictures, or it didn’t happen.
